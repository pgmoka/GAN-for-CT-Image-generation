# GAN-for-CT-Image-generation
Repository contains software which is able to create new CT images from a new CT image. The repository contains a Generative Adversarial Network in the project.py file. This network's architecture obeys object oriented architecture. More information can be found in "PGM_Progress Report"

CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PHASE
Model is able to be 

INFORMATION
This project has been based in the research work for the paper in this repository("Pix2Pix"), and the Git repository of Keras implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks(https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN)

ACHIEVED GOALS (in time implementation)
- Research GAN phase
- Class design
- Implementation of general flow
- Neural network initial implementation
    - Initial flow
    - Refactoring
- First successfull local test
- Create better, more relevant output
- Implement batch
- Migrate to stronger server to train with the full database
    - Create better input for remote machine
    - Create a guide for image creation
- Create a success standard for image creation
    - Create software to test this easily

FUTURE GOALS (in implementation priority)
- Make test output to be easier to check with original image
- Automated BRISQUE test of images
- PSNR comparison for close looking images
- Create github instructions
- Better in code documentation
