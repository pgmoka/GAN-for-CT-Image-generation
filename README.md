# GAN-for-CT-Image-generation
Repository contains software which is able to create new CT images from a new CT image

CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PHASE
Code is still being developed

INFORMATION
This project has been based in the research work for the paper in this repository, and the Git repository of Keras implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks(https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN)

ACHIEVED GOALS (in time implementation)
- Research GAN phase
- Class design
- Implementation of general flow
- Neural network initial implementation
    - Initial flow
    - Refactoring
- First successfull local test

FUTURE GOALS (in implementation priority)
- Create github
- Create better, more relevant output
- Migrate to stronger server to train with the full database
    - Create better input for remote machine
    - Create a guide for image creation
- Create a success standard for image creation
    - Create software to test this easily
- Implement batch
