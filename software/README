Execution guide

          project.py:
If the file is executed as main, it is possible to pass arguments related to the creation, trainning, and testing. 
The following are the arguments that can be passed:
--in              -> input file -- directory or single file
--in_validate     -> input file -- directory or single file
--sample          -> sample file directory for sample images to be saved
--results         -> result file directory for text related output
--epochs          -> number of epochs to train the neural network(int)
--save_file       -> file to save/load model
--batch_size      -> number of images per batch to train the neural network
--info_interval   -> Intervals where information is saved
                  
For using the file for model creation, trainning, and saving:
1) When initializing, pass batch size. Model will be created
2) call .train_model with the input data file, test file, sample file, result file, number of epochs, and interval for sample
3) Call .save_file with the file to save information

For loading model, when initializing, pass batch size, test = 0, file for loading model, validation file input, validation file output

          Directories:
During execution, it is recomended the use of the following directories:
1) data           -> Store images in .float format.
2) model          -> Store created models
3) names_log      -> directory for saving text files with split data information saved in it
4) results        -> saved text file with loss during execution
5) sample         -> saves images of test during execution
